### Actividad 1:

1. Write a program that prints ‘Hello World’ to the screen.

2. Write a program that asks the user for his/her name and greets him/her by his/her name.

4. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the integer numbers from 1 to n.

5. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the product of the integer numbers from 1 to n (factorial).

### Actividad 2:

1. Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 10.
2. Write a program that prints all prime numbers between 0 and 100.

3. Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a random number.

4. After every guess, the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small.

5. At the end, the program must print the number of tries.

6. If the user inputs the same number multiple times consecutively it doesn't count as a new try.

7. Write a program that receives the 3 angles of a triangle and determines if it is possible.
8. Write a program that receives the 3 sides of a triangle and determines if it's equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

### Actividad 3:

1. Write a program that receives a word and counts the number of vowels and consonants.
2. Write a program that receives a sentence and counts the number of words.
3. Write a program that receives 2 strings and compares them.
4. Write a program that counts the number of digits in a string.
5. Write a program that receives a string and reverses it.
6. Write a program that receives a word and tells if it's a palindrome or not.

7. Write a program that creates an array of 10 integers and calculates its average, min and max.

### Actividad 4:

1. Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.

2. Write a program that automatically converts English text to Morse code and vice versa.

3. Each number on the telephone dial (except 0 and 1) corresponds to three alphabetic characters. Those correspondences are:

   2 ABC

   3 DEF

   4 GHI

   5 JKL

   6 MNO

   7 PQRS

   8 TUV

   9 WXYZ

   Given a seven digit telephone number, print at least 5 possible "words" that number spells.

   Since the digits 0 and 1 have no alphabetic equivalent, an input number which contains those digits should be rejected.
